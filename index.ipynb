    "In this lab we are going to practice working with creating a RESTful web app that returns HTML about Tweets and Users. In this domain Users will have many Tweets and Tweets will, therefore, belong to a User. We already have our app's database set up. We will create HTML templates to render views for all of our user and tweet information stored in the database. We will query the database for the proper information, depending upon the URL, to pass onto the templates for HTML rendering. Let's get started!"
